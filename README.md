# OptimizedDisney

Users can look at current wait times for different rides, receive an expected future wait time for rides based on past data, and get an optimized route for participating in their favorite rides in the least amount of time. The suggested route takes multiple factors into account: how long it would take for the user to walk to the line, how long the current and expected future line wait times are, and how long the ride itself takes to complete. 
In the future, this application could be expanded to include an option to add fast passes into the calculations. Although we applied our program to Disneyworldâ€™s Magic Kingdom, we believe that this program can be applied to any theme park that has enough data on its wait times.
